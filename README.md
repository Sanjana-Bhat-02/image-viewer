# An Image Viewer using tkinter
This image viewer displays images to the user at a certain rate, which can be decided by the user (in seconds).
The user can also delete images in this process.

Usage: In your terminal, type:
```powershell
python viewer.py <absolute-path-to-folder> <display_time>
```
If display_time is not entered by the user, a default value of 2 seconds is used.
